# RunningWheelAnalysis
Simple scripts for analyzing mouse running wheel data

This data analysis should work for The Columbus Instruments Mouse Home Cage Running Wheel data, directly output from the software (no need for you to preprocess data before entry into analysis)

Clone the repository and run the Jupyter Notebook (wheel_trial.ipynb) in order to run the data analysis as listed here, or simply view the annotated Jupyter Notebook to see the example.
